# Notes
notes: |
  **VERIFICATION UPDATE**: Sprint status updated to reflect actual completion percentages after comprehensive codebase review.

  Epic Status Summary:
  - Epic 1-3: ✅ Truly Complete (100%)
  - Epic 4-6: 🔄 In Progress (70-80% complete, missing key components)
  - Epic 7: 🔄 In Progress (40% complete, as expected)
  - Epic 8-9: ⏳ Not Started (0% complete)

  Sprint 7 focus remains Epic 7 (Web Automation & Search), which is the critical
  capability for Manus Internal's strategic intelligence gathering.

  Story 7-1 (Playwright Browser Setup) and 7-2 (Web Search) are complete
  and provide solid foundation for remaining stories.

  **Key Issues Identified**: Over-reporting of completion status for Epics 4-6. Need to
  focus on completing missing components:
  - Epic 4: Auto-summarization pipeline
  - Epic 5: Comprehensive approval gates system
  - Epic 6: Google Docs/Sheets creation and editing tools

  Performance targets remain aggressive for browser operations to ensure
  good user experience in Agent Mode. Resource management is critical to avoid memory
  leaks and browser zombie processes.
