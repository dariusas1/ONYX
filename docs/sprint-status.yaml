      race condition with atomic operations, (3) Fixed snippet truncation edge case,
      (4) Added credential masking in logs, (5) Implemented aiohttp session reuse
      (100-200ms faster). All 6 acceptance criteria still met. Code quality improved

notes: "\u26A0\uFE0F **CRITICAL PROJECT STATUS CORRECTION**: Previous status showed\
  \ Epics 1-6 as \"done\"\nbut investigation revealed they have never been implemented.\
  \ Only Epic 3 (partial)\nand Epic 7 have actual story files and implementations.\n\
  \n**ACTUAL PROJECT STATE:**\n- Epic 1 (Foundation): NOT STARTED - Critical dependency\
  \ for all other epics\n- Epic 2 (Chat Interface): TECH SPEC ONLY - Comprehensive\
  \ 1,840-line spec exists\n- Epic 3 (RAG): PARTIALLY COMPLETE - 2/2 stories done,\
  \ needs additional RAG features\n- Epic 4-6: NOT STARTED - Blocked on Epic 1-3 dependencies\n\
  - Epic 7: IN PROGRESS - 2/5 stories complete, 3 remaining stories ready\n\n**IMMEDIATE\
  \ PRIORITY RECOMMENDATION:**\n1. Complete Epic 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure) -\
  \ blocks everything else\n2. Implement Epic 2 (Chat Interface) - core user interaction\
  \ capability\n3. Continue Epic 7 (Web Automation) - can proceed in parallel\n\n\
  Sprint 7 continues focus on Epic 7 (Web Automation & Search), which provides\ncritical\
  \ autonomous research capabilities. Stories 7-3, 7-4, 7-5 are ready for\nimplementation\
  \ with all dependencies satisfied.\n\nPerformance targets remain aggressive (<2s\
  \ browser startup, <5s page load) for\noptimal user experience in Agent Mode.\n"
