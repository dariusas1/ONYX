# Notes
notes: |
  **STORY 5.1 COMPLETED**: Story 5.1 (Agent Mode Toggle & UI) drafted with comprehensive specifications. Foundation for Agent Mode functionality.

  Epic Status Summary:
  - Epic 1-3: ✅ Truly Complete (100%)
  - Epic 4: ✅ Complete (100%) - All stories drafted with comprehensive specifications
  - Epic 5: 🔄 In Progress (85% complete, Story 5.1 foundation added)
  - Epic 6-7: 🔄 In Progress (70-80% complete, missing key components)
  - Epic 7: 🔄 In Progress (40% complete, as expected)
  - Epic 8-9: ⏳ Contexted (100% specified)

  Sprint 7 focus remains Epic 7 (Web Automation & Search), which is the critical
  capability for Manus Internal's strategic intelligence gathering.

  Story 7-1 (Playwright Browser Setup) and 7-2 (Web Search) are complete
  and provide solid foundation for remaining stories.

  **NEW**: Epic 4 Stories Ready for Sprint 8 Development:
  - Story 4-1: Memory Schema & Storage System (8 points, P0)
  - Story 4-2: Standing Instructions Management (6 points, P0)
  - Story 4-3: Memory Injection & Agent Integration (7 points, P0)
  - Story 4-4: Auto-Summarization Pipeline (8 points, P1)

  Performance targets remain aggressive for browser operations to ensure
  good user experience in Agent Mode. Resource management is critical to avoid memory
  leaks and browser zombie processes.
